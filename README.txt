Basic Analog and Digital Clock Project in Unity
By Tad Dolphay
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a simple example project I created with the help of a Catlike Coding tutorial found here: http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/game-objects-and-scripts/.

This example is similar to the completed project on that site with the addition of a digital clock component which indicates the hour and minute.

This is a simple test project to play around with the Unity tools and figure out some new features to expand on a tutorial project.

In order to run, simply download Unity (https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) and open the project and run it through the IDE.

There is an option to have continuous or discrete clock movement available by selecting the 'Clock' object in the hierarchy menu and simply checking or unchecking the continuous option under the Clock script.
